# Faces

The Minigotchi has multiple faces, similar to that of the Pwnagotchi. I tried my best here to adhere to how emotions were handled with the Pwnagotchi. It doesn't exactly have an emotion set using a setting, but rather having the emotion being shown to the user.

### (^-^) Happy

- found a Pwnagotchi
- can say the stats while happy

### (;-;) Sad

- can't find a Pwnagotchi
- can't find any APs

### (X-X) Broken

- An error while the program was running has occurred
- Usually, an error will be provided, or it will tell you what the issue is

```
(X-X) An error has occurred!
(X-X) <The actual error here>
```

### (>-<) Intense

- sending frames to an AP
- sending *Pwnagotchi-like* beacon frame
- doing any task of some sort that may require resources

### (0-o) (o-0) Looking around

- looking for a Pwnagotchi, scanning for APs

### ('-') Neutral

- normal face on startup
- may have something to say

### (-.-) Sleeping

- switching channel
