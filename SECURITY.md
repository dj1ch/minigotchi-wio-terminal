# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

When it comes to installing any version of the project, I highly recommend you install the latest version available. Anything version under or equal to `1.1.1-beta` is going to have some sort of issue whether it be compile errors or not functioning as expected. Keep in mind configuration is different between x.0.0 releases!

Proper C/C++ practices are implemented more often in higher releases, with better performance and speed, and a lower chance of memory issues upon encountering something unexpected.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| < 3.0.0-beta   | :white_check_mark: Recommended! |
| < 2.0.0-beta   | :white_check_mark: Works... |
| 1.3.0-beta   | :white_check_mark: Not recommended! |
| 1.2.0-beta   | :white_check_mark: Not recommended!              |
| =< 1.1.1-beta   | :x: Broken...               |
